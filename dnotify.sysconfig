# This file allows you to specify instances of dnotify
# that should be started by the dnotify init script.
# Each line that does not start with a # character
# represents an instance of dnotify command to start.
# The line will contain the command line args to pass dnotify.
# E.G. (of course without the #):
# -CDMRB -r /etc/httpd -e service httpd configtest >> /var/log/dnotify
# -CDMR -p1q0 /var/mirror/urpm -e su -c'/usr/local/bin/rebuildhdlist >> /var/log/urpmirror' urpmirror
